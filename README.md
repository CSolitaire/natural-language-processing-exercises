## Natural Language Processing
****
### Summary

    NLP or Natural Language Processing (not Neurolinguistic Processing).
    Use programming & machine learning techniques to help understand and make use of large amounts of text data.

### Use Cases

    Voice of Customer Analytics: Improve products and services through analysis of customer interactions, such as support emails, social media posts, online comments, telephone transcriptions, i.e., to discover what factors drive the most positive and negative experiences. An example would be to extract key phrases and topics by summarizing blocks of text from open-ended survey responses in order to extract the most important and central ideas that can lead to actionable insights.

    Semantic Search: Provide a better search experience by enabling your search engine to index key phrases, entities, and sentiment. This enables you to focus the search on the intent and the context of the articles instead of basic keywords.

    Knowledge Management & Discovery: Organize and categorize your documents by topic for easier discovery. You might want to personalize content recommendations for readers by recommending other articles related to the same topic. Or you might want to ensure the security of documents by closely monitoring those documents containing sensitive materials (Topic Modeling).

### Methods

    **Text Classification:**

        Assign tags or categories to text according to its content.

        Applications: sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.

        Similar to topic modeling, but is supervised learning, so the set of possible classes are known/defined in advance.

    **Topic Modeling:**

        Discover the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents.

        Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a commonly used algorithm.

        Similar to text classification but is unsupervised, like clustering, so the set of possible topics are unknown prior. The topics are defined as part of generating the topic models.
